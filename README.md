Assorted collection of Python scrips for hybrid pixel detectors



## Idea 

Semi independent utils package for common tasks surrounding pixel detectors. Dependencies should be kept fairly low, but common python packages are ok. Distribution through conda with frequent updates.  

## To implement 

* info from numpy files
* merge files, (with safety checks)
